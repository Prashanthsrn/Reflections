When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  It is useful when multiple people are working on a project. People can divife the work and upload it on a remote repository to complete the project in a shorter duration.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	if we are collabrating with someone , the changes they made might not be compatible with our code. So it si always better to manually pull changes becasuse in this way we can kepp a track of the changes.
